** Preface

This book is for Scala developers with an Object Oriented (OOP)
background who wish to learn the *Functional Programming* (FP)
paradigm.

Until now, Scala has lacked a practical introduction to FP. We do not
believe that learning Haskell should be a prerequisite. We also do not
accept that the merits of FP are obvious. Therefore, this book
justifies every concept with practical examples, in Scala.

We recommend [[https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala][The Red Book]] as optional further reading. It is a
textbook to learn the fundamentals and write your own FP library in
Scala, serving a different purpose than this book.

We also recommend [[http://haskellbook.com/][Haskell Programming from First Principles]] as
optional further reading. FP innovation has traditionally been in
Haskell because it is the academic standard. But Scala has gained much
more traction in industry and brings with it features, stability,
interop, powerful frameworks and a commercial ecosystem.

** Practicalities

If you'd like to set up a project that uses the libraries presented in
this book, you will need to use a recent version of Scala with
FP-specific features enabled (e.g. in =build.sbt=):

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
scalaVersion in ThisBuild := "2.12.1"
scalacOptions in ThisBuild ++= Seq(
  "-language:_",
  "-Ypartial-unification"
)
#+END_SRC

and add the following dependencies to your project's settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
  "io.circe" %% "circe-core",
  "io.circe" %% "circe-generic",
  "io.circe" %% "circe-parser"
).map(_ % "0.7.0") ++ Seq(
  "org.typelevel" %% "cats"     % "0.9.0",
  "com.spinoco"   %% "fs2-http" % "0.1.6"
)

resolvers += Resolver.sonatypeRepo("snapshots")
addCompilerPlugin("org.scalamacros" %  "paradise"  % "2.1.0" cross CrossVersion.full)
libraryDependencies += "com.47deg"  %% "freestyle" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
#+END_SRC

In order to keep our snippets short, we will omit the =import=
section. Unless told otherwise, assume that all snippets have the
following imports:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
import cats._
import cats.implicits._
import freestyle._
import freestyle.implicits._
import fs2._
#+END_SRC

** Introduction

It is human instinct to be sceptical of a new paradigm. To put some
perspective on how far we have come, and the shifts we have already
accepted on the JVM, let's start with a quick recap of the last 20
years.

Java 1.2 introduced the Collections API, allowing us to write methods
that abstracted over mutable collections. It was useful for writing
general purpose algorithms and was the bedrock of our codebases.

But there was a problem, we had to perform runtime casting:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
public String first(Collection collection) {
  return (String)(collection.get(0));
}
#+END_SRC

In response, developers defined domain objects in their business logic
that were effectively =CollectionOfThings=, and the Collection API
became implementation detail.

In 2005, Java 5 introduced /generics/, allowing us to define
=Collection<Thing>=, abstracting over the container *and* its
elements. Generics changed how we wrote Java.

The author of the Java generics compiler, Martin Odersky, then created
Scala with a stronger type system, immutable data structures and
multiple inheritance. This brought about a fusion of object oriented
(OOP) and functional programming (FP).

For most developers, FP means using immutable data structures as much
as possible, but mutable state is still a necessary evil that must be
isolated and managed, e.g. with Akka. This style of FP results in
simpler programs that are easier to parallelise and distribute, an
improvement over Java. But it is only scratching the surface of the
benefits of FP, as we'll discover in this book.

Scala also brings =Future=, making it easy to write asynchronous
applications. But when a =Future= makes it into a return type,
/everything/ needs to be rewritten to accomodate it, including the
tests, which are now subject to arbitrary timeouts.

We have a problem similar to Java 1.0: there is no way of abstracting
over execution, much as we had no way of abstracting over collections.

*** Abstracting over Execution

Let's say we want to interact with the user over the command line
interface. We can =read= what the user types and we can =write= a
message to them.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
trait TerminalSync {
  def read(): String
  def write(t: String): Unit
}

trait TerminalAsync {
  def read(): Future[String]
  def write(t: String): Future[Unit]
}
#+END_SRC

But how do we write generic code that does something as simple as echo
the user's input synchronously or asynchronously depending on our
runtime implementation?

We could write a synchronous version and wrap it with =Future= but now
we have to worry about which thread pool we should be using for the
work, or we could =Await.result= on the =Future= and introduce thread
blocking. In either case, it's a lot of boilerplate and we are
fundamentally dealing with different APIs that are not unified.

Let's try to solve the problem like Java 1.2 by introducing a common
parent. To do this, we need to use the /higher kinded types/ Scala
language feature. This provides the /type constructor/, which looks
like =C[_]=, a way of saying that whatever goes here must take a type
parameter but we don't care what that parameter is. In our case, we
want to define =Terminal= for a type constructor =C[_]= allowing us to
use types like =C[String]= and =C[Unit]= in our method signatures:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
trait Terminal[C[_]] {
  def read: C[String]
  def write(t: String): C[Unit]
}
#+END_SRC

By defining =Now[_]= to construct to /itself/ (a powerful trick that
takes a moment to understand), we can implement a common interface for
synchronous and asynchronous terminals:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
type Now[+X] = X

object TerminalSync extends Terminal[Now] {
  def read: String = ???
  def write(t: String): Unit = ???
}

object TerminalAsync extends Terminal[Future] {
  def read: Future[String] = ???
  def write(t: String): Future[Unit] = ???
}
#+END_SRC

You can think of =C= as a /Context/ because we say "in the context of
executing =Now=" or "in the =Future=".

But we know nothing about =C= and if we are given a =C[String]= we
can't get the =String=. However, even though =Now= and =Future= don't
share a common parent, we can depend on a parameterised trait that
will give us methods to call on =C=.

What we need is a kind of execution environment that lets us call a
method returning =C[T]= and then be able to do something with the =T=,
including calling another method on =Terminal=. We also need a way of
wrapping a value as a =C[?]=. This signature works well:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
trait Execution[C[_]] {
  def doAndThen[A, B](c: C[A])(f: A => C[B]): C[B]
  def wrap[B](b: B): C[B]
}
#+END_SRC

letting us write:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def echo[C[_]](t: Terminal[C], e: Execution[C]): C[String] =
  e.doAndThen(t.read) { in: String =>
    e.doAndThen(t.write(in)) { _: Unit =>
      e.wrap(in)
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

We can now share the =echo= implementation between synchronous and
asynchronous codepaths! We only need to write an implementation for
=Execution[Now]= and =Execution[Future]= once and we can reuse it
forever, for any method like this. We can trivially write a mock
implementation of =Terminal[Now]= and use it in a test for =echo=.

But the code is horrible. Let's use the =implicit class= Scala
language feature (aka "enriching" or "ops") to give =C= some nicer
methods when there is an implicit =Execution= available. We'll call
these methods =flatMap= and =map= for reasons that will become clearer
in a moment:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
object Execution {
  implicit class Ops[A, C[_]](m: C[A])(implicit e: Execution[C]) {
    def flatMap[B](f: A => C[B]): C[B] = e.doAndThen(m)(f)
    def map[B](f: A => B): C[B] = e.doAndThen(m)(f andThen e.wrap)
  }
}
#+END_SRC

cleaning up =echo= a little bit

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def echo[C[_]](implicit t: Terminal[C], e: Execution[C]): C[String] =
  t.read.flatMap { in: String =>
    t.write(in).map { _: Unit =>
      in
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

we can now reveal why we used =flatMap= as the method name: it lets us
use a /for comprehension/, which is just syntax sugar over nested
=flatMap= and =map=.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
def echo[C[_]](implicit t: Terminal[C], e: Execution[C]): C[String] =
  for {
    in <- t.read
     _ <- t.write(in)
  } yield in
#+END_SRC

Our =Execution= has the same signature as a trait in the cats library
called =Monad= (except =doAndThen= is =flatMap= and =wrap= is =pure=).
We say that =C= is /monadic/ when there is an implicit =Monad[C]=
available. In addition, our =Now= is exactly the same as cats' =Id=.

The takeaway is: if we write methods that operate on monadic types,
then we can write procedural code that abstracts over its execution
context. Here, we have shown an abstraction over synchronous and
asynchronous execution but it can also be for the purpose of more
rigorous error handling (where =C[_]= is =Either[Error, _]=) or
recording / auditing of the session.

*** Pure Functional Programming

FP functions have three key properties:

- *Totality* return a value for every possible input
- *Determinism* return the same value for the same input
- *Purity* the only effect is the computation of a return value.

Together, these properties give us an unprecedented ability to reason
about our code. For example, caching is easier to understand with
determinism and purity, and input validation is easier to isolate with
totality.

The kinds of things that break these properties are /side effects/,
e.g. accessing or changing mutable state (e.g. generating random
numbers, maintaining a =var= in a class), communicating with external
resources (e.g. files or network lookup), or throwing exceptions.

But in Scala, we perform side effects all the time. A call to
=println= will perform I/O and a call to =asString= on a =Http=
instance will speak to a web server. It's fair to say that typical
Scala is *not* FP.

However, something beautiful happened when we wrote our implementation
of =echo=. Anything that depends on state or external resources is
provided as an explicit input: our functions are deterministic and
pure. We not only get to abstract over execution environment, but we
also get to dramatically improve the repeatability - and performance -
of our tests. For example, we are free to implement =Terminal= without
any interactions with a real console.

Of course we cannot write an application devoid of interaction with
the world. In FP we push the code that deals with side effects to the
edges. That kind of code can use battle-tested libraries like NIO,
Akka and Play.

This book expands on the FP style introduced in this chapter. We're
going to use the traits and classes defined in the /cats/ and /fs2/
libraries to implement streaming applications. We'll also use the
/freestyle/ and /simulacrum/ developer tooling to eliminate
boilerplate, allowing you to focus on writing pure business logic.

** TODO =for=

We're going to be using these a lot. Need to be comfortable with it.

Include a lot of stuff from "For: what is it good for?"

*** RESEARCH Monad Transformers

Maybe too early? Let's say put it here if we need it for the
interpreters, otherwise after Optics.

** TODO Implicits

Perhaps need a refresher on how implicits work.

** TODO Example

Just the high level concepts. Ask the reader to suspend their belief
of =@free= and we'll explain what it's doing later, plus the algebraic
mixing.

And an =Id= based test to show that we can really write business logic
tests without a real implementation.

An architect's dream: you can focus on algebras, business logic and
functional requirements, and delegate the implementations to your
teams.

** TODO Pure business logic

(the cross-over from previous section is not yet clear)

We can define things that are like Java =interface=s, but with the
container and its implementation abstracted away, called an Algebra.

We can write all our business logic solely by combining these
algebras. If you ever want to call some code that can throw an
exception or speaks to the outside world, wrap it in an algebra so it
can be abstracted.

Everything can now be mocked, and we can write tests just of the
business logic.

Include some thoughts from [[http://degoes.net/articles/easy-monads][Beginner Friendly Tour]]

** RESEARCH Parallel work

Generating the initial state and https://github.com/fommil/drone-dynamic-agents/issues/6

Might require a moment to explain =FreeApplicative= (I'd rather not get into details yet).

** TODO Reality Check

- solved initial abstraction problem
- clean way to write logic and divide labour
- easier to write maintainable and testable code

Three steps forward but one step back: performance.

High level overview of what =@free= and =@module= is doing, and the
concept of trampolining. For a detailed explanation of free style and
the cats free monad implementation, see the appendix.

*** RESEARCH perf numbers
** TODO Typeclasses

look into the oauth / google / drone algebras as examples.

how cats uses typeclasses, e.g. to provide the =flatMap= on the free
monad and =|+|= on applicatives.

Discourage hierarchies except for ADTs

** TODO Cats
*** RESEARCH typeclasses

Foldable being imminently more interesting than the others.

Traversable will need to be discussed, seems to come up a lot.

*** RESEARCH data types

Not really sure what to say here.

** TODO Spotting patterns, refactoring

Note that some of our algebras are actually common things and can be
rewritten: reader / writer / state / error / indexed monad. It's ok
that this is a step you can do later.

These are called Effects.

** CODE FS2 Streams

The basics, and covering the Effect, which can be our free monad.

Why streams are so awesome. I'd like a simple example here of reading
from a huge data source, doing parallel work and then writing out in
order to a (slower) device to demonstrate backpressure and constant
memory overhead. Maybe compare this vs hand rolled and akka streams
for a perf test?

Rewrite our business logic to be streaming, convert our GET api into a
=Stream= by polling.

** TODO interpreters

Show that although interpreters can be as messy as you like, you can
continue to write them as a pure core with side effects pushed to the
outside.

** TODO type refinement

instead of needing those =error= calls in the first place, just don't
allow them to happen at your layer if you can get away with it.

Protect yourself from mistyping

** RESEARCH Optics

not sure what the relevance to this project would be yet.
