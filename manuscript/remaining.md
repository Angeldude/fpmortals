The following should suffice (in this order)

-   object, val, def, if, primitives, types
-   trait, class, abstract class (construction, methods, inheritance / type hierarchy)
-   String, List and Future as examples (including a brief look at for)
-   case class and pattern matching
-   a brief introduction to implicit

ADTs, for, typeclasses and implicit, and algebras are covered in detail in the main body of my book. As well as many warnings about Future.
