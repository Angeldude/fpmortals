Thank you for wanting to give feedback on this book.

You have selected the option to make a suggestion that you feel would improve
the book, although it is neither an error nor something you are still confused
about.

If you can suggest wording that would suit you better, I will take it into
consideration. However, please do not be offended if your suggestion is not
taken forward.
