# Technical Errors

You have a technical error to report, please include details of the text and the
correction.

There is no need to report spelling or grammatical mistakes.

# Explanation

You do not understand something in the book:

- which piece of text is causing a problem?
- how much experience do you have with Scala?

This information helps me to rewrite the text for the target audience.

# Suggestions

You have a suggestion that you feel would improve the book that is neither an
error nor something you are still confused about.

If you can suggest wording that would suit you better, I will take it into
consideration. However, please do not be offended if your suggestion is not
taken forward.
